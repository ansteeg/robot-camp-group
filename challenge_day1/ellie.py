    print(f"In a single night, their peaceful lives were changed forever. {D()}, traumatized by his helplessness, craved strength above all else, in order to protect the people he loves. {T()}, the younger brother, was more unlucky, unable to overcome their parents’ death. While Quijote trained, {T()} strayed, hiding from the weight of loss behind false courage and the poisons that dulled his pain. Yet the tragedy of Kallin was not theirs alone. {P()} too had lost her parents to Git, her throne turned into a burden she could not yet bear. {J()}, who dreamed of traveling the land, would find no choice but to raise his hand in battle. {N()}, in his strange obsession with rebuilding broken things, saw only more shattered lives to mend. And {A()}, born of shadow, was drawn to the river of blood spilling out. Each carried scars of their own, but together, these wounds would bind them. This was the beginning of the Robaddies, forged not in glory, but in fire, grief, and the promise of vengeance against Git.")

In an inconceivably silent moment in the war, as if it were the calm before the storm. Our heroes stood on the frontline, filled with hopes to bring this catastrophe to the end. {P()} stepped behind {D()}. For one heartbeat, he believed she stood at his side as comrade, as queen, as ally. But her dagger slid between his ribs, and his cry broke the night. {T()} turned, screaming his brother’s name, while {J()}’s arrow faltered mid-flight. {N()} froze, his monstrous creations stalling, and even {A()} recoiled with a hiss. {P()}’s eyes burned with a grief too twisted to name. “The Git cannot be destroyed,” she whispered, “but I can survive.” Don Quijote collapsed, the hero undone by the very one he trusted most. The battlefield stilled, and in that silence, Git’s laughter echoed. The Robaddies’ fate was sealed, victory belonged not to them, but to betrayal.")
