Gog, ever the skeptik, just squinted at the single shining fork and muttered, “This is going to end in merge konflicts.” Yet somehow, after all that noize, six sparkling forks appeered on the table: each one slightly diffarent, slightly suspishus, and already demanding a commit mesage before the first bite..'

Mob and Gog work at the same café, where they argue daily about who makes the better curry branch. Rob and Bob could not stop laffing, but they needed to get to werk—yet their only “werk” for the day was reviewing Blob’s pull req, which accidently replaced all the curry with coffee. Snob, unimpressed, simply opend an issue: “Stop mixing beverajes with dinner.”'

Snob, tryin to act seriouz, wrote in the README: “True luv between piglets is stronger than any merge konflict.” Blob clapped his tiny hoovs, Mob opend a pull req for group hugz, and Gog just typed git push --all-hearts into the starrs.
