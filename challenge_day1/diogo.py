Soon, the pitch black night sky that covers the ground of this desolated town will be filled with beacon of fires.

Unaware that it was coming from the thousands of horse charging to the town. The beautiful dark sky that is veiling over the town, was illuminated abrutly one, two, thousands of beacon lights filling the entire sky like the sunrise is coming up.  The citizen of a peaceful land, Kallin, with no fighting instinct was astounded by the sights of the arrows raining on them. The citizens, without the Hero Party (Don Quijote, Don Tour, Princess Dia, Dinh Jin Ping, Doctor Nikki, Dracula) protection, the people can only try and defend themselves in vain.")
