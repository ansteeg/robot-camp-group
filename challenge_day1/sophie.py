 She wheezed, coughed, then pointed at Greg with her glitter pen like it was a dagger of truth. 
 You come into our sacred meeting space, she croaked dramatically, and insult the soul of this magazine?
 Our metaphors are curated expressions of existential longingâ€”how dare you. She punctuated the word dare 
 with a jab of her pen, causing an unfortunate explosion of glitter over the meeting notes."""

 for sustainability."""
