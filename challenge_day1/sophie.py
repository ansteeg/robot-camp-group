slammed the table so hard that two croissants became airborne. This, he 
thundered, "is not budgeting. This is financial terrorism!" A hush fell 
over the room, except for the sound of the intern quietly choking on a raisin scone. 
Margaret shot back with a glare so sharp it could cut cardboard, preparing to deliver 
a manifesto about how stationery is the bedrock of civilization. Margaret squared her shoulders,
Harold glared, Greg clapped once—slowly—the intern choked back a cough, and the janitor inspected
the ceiling for croissant shrapnel."""

 She wheezed, coughed, then pointed at Greg with her glitter pen like it was a dagger of truth. 
 You come into our sacred meeting space, she croaked dramatically, and insult the soul of this magazine?
 Our metaphors are curated expressions of existential longing—how dare you. She punctuated the word dare 
 with a jab of her pen, causing an unfortunate explosion of glitter over the meeting notes. Harold muttered 
 about cleanup, Greg folded his arms, Margaret pointed with her pen, the intern chased the glitter, and the
 janitor opened a window."""

 debates about whether croissants should be classified as breakfast philosophy or editorial theory. Greg 
 suggested replacing the entire magazine with a single annual crossword puzzle that contained only the word 
 Bloom. Harold countered with a subscription model that mailed readers a single raisin each month as a metaphor 
 for sustainability. Margaret called for a truce, Harold kept minutes for once, Greg proposed a crossword coup,
 the intern recorded every vote, and the janitor unplugged the projector."""
