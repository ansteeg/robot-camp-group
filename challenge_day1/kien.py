The peaceful time on Kallin stood no chance, the army of the night was running all over town, chaos erupted everywhere. The chief guard, Don John, father to {D()} and {T()}, can only stood still in front of his house in the hope of protecting his family. Sword drawn, he slashes down countless of enemies, in the town that is engulfed by flames. Hearing the desperate cries of the citizen, unable to contain himself Don John rushes into the hellish battle to help. Seeing her husband rush into battle, Daniela, their mom, can only rush the boys safety in the hope that they will survive. Being rushed by the unsurmountable of Git soldiers, their mother can only stay behind as bait in order for her boys to survive. This event is the major gear that forms the Robaddies party of {D()}, {P()}, {J()}, {N()}, {A()}, and {A()}.")

Thousands of bats swarmed the battlefield, tearing through flesh and bones. Together, the Robaddies seemed unstoppable, yet the enemy was endless.")
