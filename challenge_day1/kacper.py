Just as it seemed Bloom magazine would collapse under the weight of pastry crumbs 
and insults, Margaret stood, glitter pen in hand like a sword, and proposed a duel: 
One haiku each. Winner takes Bloom. Harold scribbled furiously about fiscal responsibility, 
Greg wrote "Bloom bad" seventeen times and called it minimalist genius, and Margaret 
produced an ode to croissants that accidentally made everyone cry. 
In the end nobody won, the meeting notes were illegible, and Bloom magazine survived 
another day simply because the janitor locked the lights and went home."""
