This is because she was next in line for the town of Kallin, and Git killed her parents and then she had to become queen but she didn’t want to. She didn’t want to be queen in the time of Git. She knew she had to destroy Git before she would even deem herself worthy of the throne. Thus, {P()} joined the Robaddies to avenge Git for the lives of her parents. ")

Here lies a small family of 4, Don John, the head guard of the town, with his wife and two childs, {T()} and {D()}.  “Catch it! Catch it!!” “I got it ! Ahhhhh!!!!” “{D()}! You suck !! how do you always miss the target last second {D()}?” “Ouchhhh, the sun was shining in my eyes. I couldn’t see it.” The green hills, blue skyline, and warm sun are the only things that the two young boys have known. Whether it was their fate or for the better, their peace was coming to an end.")

Interested after hearing the Don name, {N()} and {A()} walk over as well. They all order a drink, which brings them on the topic of the increased drink prices after the Git came to reign. They all start to bond over their mutual hate for the Git, and how he has influenced the economy in a way that their beers now cost 2x as much.")
