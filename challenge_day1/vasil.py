This is because she was next in line for the town of Kallin, and Git killed her parents and then she had to become queen but she didn’t want to. She didn’t want to be queen in the time of Git. She knew she had to destroy Git before she would even deem herself worthy of the throne. Thus, Princess Dia joined the Robaddies to avenge Git for the lives of her parents. ")

Interested after hearing the Don name, Doctor Nikki and Dracula walk over as well. They all order a drink, which brings them on the topic of the increased drink prices after the Git came to reign. They all start to bond over their mutual hate for the Git, and how he has influenced the economy in a way that their beers now cost 2x as much.")
