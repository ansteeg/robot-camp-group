        Tension filled the air like a badly timed incense stick. Margaret clutched her glitter pens to her chest as though 
shielding them from Greg's dark aura. "You don't understand," she whispered fiercely. "Without Bloom, the world will 
descend into beige despair." Greg rolled his eyes so hard he nearly sprained them. Harold licked a croissant crumb 
off his tie and muttered, "Beige might be cheaper.Margaret stared him down, Harold counted crumbs, Greg drummed his fingers, 
the intern peeked over a laptop, and the janitor slowly turned the lights back on."

        By the week’s end, the staff gathered for a toast with lukewarm seltzer, declaring Bloom “immortal, 
or at least annoyingly persistent.” The janitor, overhearing them, sighed, turned off the lights again, 
and muttered: “If I ignore them long enough, maybe they’ll turn into a podcast.Margaret lifted a glass, Harold nodded, Greg muttered “temporarily,” the intern filmed the moment, 
and the janitor warned them not to spill on the floor.”

        The tension in the room reached a fever pitch. For a moment, it seemed as though the meeting would erupt into a full-blown 
literary fistfight—punctuated with passive-aggressive footnotes and sarcastic MLA citations. 
Greg stood tall (or at least average height), daring anyone to challenge his anti-Bloom crusade. Margaret and Harold exchanged a glance, 
the kind usually reserved for people realizing they might have to work together to defeat a shared boss in a video game. Something had to give.Margaret and Harold edged closer, Greg planted his feet, 
the intern held the door just in case, and the janitor checked the fire extinguisher.
