        Tension filled the air like a badly timed incense stick. Margaret clutched her glitter pens to her chest as though 
shielding them from Greg's dark aura. "You don't understand," she whispered fiercely. "Without Bloom, the world will 
descend into beige despair." Greg rolled his eyes so hard he nearly sprained them. Harold licked a croissant crumb 
off his tie and muttered, "Beige might be cheaper."

        By the week’s end, the staff gathered for a toast with lukewarm seltzer, declaring Bloom “immortal, 
or at least annoyingly persistent.” The janitor, overhearing them, sighed, turned off the lights again,

        The tension in the room reached a fever pitch. For a moment, it seemed as though the meeting would erupt into a full-blown 
literary fistfight—punctuated with passive-aggressive footnotes and sarcastic MLA citations.

the kind usually reserved for people realizing they might have to work together to defeat a shared boss in a video game. Something had to give.
