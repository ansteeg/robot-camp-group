        Tension filled the air like a badly timed incense stick. 
        Lewis clutched a stack of glitter pens to his chest as though 
        shielding them from some invisible threat. 
        "You don't understand," he whispered fiercely. 
        "Without Bloom, the world will descend into beige despair." 
        Lewis straightened his tie, drummed his fingers on the table,

        By the week’s end, Lewis raised a glass of lukewarm seltzer 
        and declared Bloom “immortal, or at least annoyingly persistent.” 
        He sighed, set the glass back down, and muttered to himself: 
        “If I ignore this long enough, maybe it’ll just turn into a podcast.” 
        Lewis lifted the glass again, nodded gravely, and warned no one in particular

        The tension in the room reached a fever pitch. 
        For a moment, it seemed as though the meeting would erupt 
        into a full-blown literary fistfight—punctuated with 
        passive-aggressive footnotes and sarcastic MLA citations. 
        Lewis stood tall (or at least average height), daring the silence 
        to challenge his crusade. He planted his feet, glanced at the door, 
        and finally checked the fire extinguisher—just in case.
