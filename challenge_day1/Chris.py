  act1="""Margaret gasped so loudly that three pigeons outside the window startled and flew off. Harold, secretly 
  pleased that someone else was angry at Margaret, leaned back with a smirk and muttered, "Finally, someone 
  who speaks sense." The intern, unsure whether to take minutes or dial emergency services, quietly wrote "apocalypse???" in the meeting notes. 
  Greg rolled his eyes from the doorway while the intern froze, and the janitor paused mid-stride with his keys;
  Margaret and Harold pretended not to notice."""

  Margaret let out a strangled scream and tried to shield the others’ eyes. 
  “We are professionals, Greg! Not savages!” she said, nearly choking again on residual croissant dust. Greg shrugged.
  “It’s called aesthetic minimalism. Look it up.” He tried to sit on the table for effect but missed and nearly took out the complimentary fruit bowl.
  The intern scribbled it all down as the janitor hovered by the light switch, while Margaret, Harold, and Greg argued about fonts."""

  act3="""In desperation, Harold suggested outsourcing content to fortune cookies. 
  They immediately received a sample issue filled with predictions like “Your magazine will almost succeed today” 
  and “Beware of raisins.” Readers loved it, confusing it for satire, and sales inexplicably spiked.
  Greg began pitching Bloom as the “only publication printed entirely by destiny.
  Margaret called it visionary, Harold claimed it was efficient, Greg said it was destiny, 
  the intern nodded gravely, and even the janitor agreed it beat sweeping glitter.”"""
