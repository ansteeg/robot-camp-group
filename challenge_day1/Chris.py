  startled and flew off. He leaned back with a smirk and muttered, 
  "Finally, someone who speaks sense." Then, with dramatic flair,

  “Is that… Comic Sans?” he whispered, scandalized. 
  He nearly choked on residual croissant dust but steadied himself. 
  “We are professionals! Not savages!” he declared, slamming his hand

  over the complimentary fruit bowl."""

  to fortune cookies. Within days, a sample issue appeared filled with 
  predictions like “Your magazine will almost succeed today” and 
  “Beware of raisins.” Readers loved it, confusing it for satire,

  of the chaos, declaring: “This is destiny.”"""
