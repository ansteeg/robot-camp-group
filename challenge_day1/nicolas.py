Soon, the pitch black night sky that covers the ground of this desolated town will be filled with beacon of fires. The people of Kallin, alerted by the roaring noise coming out of town, all started waking up and coming out of their house in the middle of the night. Unaware that it was coming from the thousands of horse charging to the town. The beautiful dark sky that is veiling over the town, was illuminated abrutly one, two, thousands of beacon lights filling the entire sky like the sunrise is coming up.  The citizen of a peaceful land, Kallin, with no fighting instinct was astounded by the sights of the arrows raining on them. The citizens, without the Hero Party ({D()}, {P()}, {J()}, {N()}, {A()}, and {T()}) protection, the people can only try and defend themselves in vain. ")
